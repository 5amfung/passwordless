# Passwordless

Passwordless is a node.js module for [express](http://expressjs.com/) that allows *authentication* and *authorization* without passwords but simply by sending tokens via email or other means. It utilizes a very similar mechanism as many sites use for resetting passwords. The module was inspired by Justin Balthrop's aritcle "[Passwords are Obsolete](https://medium.com/@ninjudd/passwords-are-obsolete-9ed56d483eb)"

The module is particularly useful if:
* you would like to avoid the implicit risks of passwords (such as users reusing them across sites), or
* your site is only visited infrequently or has long-lasting sessions, or
* you don't want to burden your users with passwords, or
* you want to have your users started by just entering their email, or
* you have just a handful of fixed users and want to avoid the trouble of a full user auth system

## Usage

Install the module:

`$ npm install passwordless --save`

Afterwards...

```javascript
// to be finalized

```

## Options

To be finalized

## Tests
